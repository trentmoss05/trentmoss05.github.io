For my javascript portfolio project, I added on to my rails Budget App that I created for the Rails project. Working with javascript was a huge change from rails, although there were many familiar concepts, the syntax was not so familiar. Rails just seems so much more readable than javascript.

After finishing the project I think I have gained fairly good grasp on javascript.

I added a few features to my budget app, one being a button you can click after creating an account and creating an event (birthday, wedding, etc.) you can now click a "brief info" link which pops up brief information on the event. The other features that I added are, the ability to add an expense to an event through JSON and append it to the page without reloading the page, and also a button on the event show page, that will show all other events created by the user who created that event, again without reloading the page.

From working on this project, even though very simple features, I can really see the different things you can pull off with javascript, the possibilities of having Ruby on Rails and Javascript seems endless.
