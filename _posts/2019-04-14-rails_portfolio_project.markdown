The hardest part of working on this project, was determining what I wanted my app to be on. I have recently gotten really into budgeting, and thought that would work well for this type of project. Besides that, getting started always seems to be the hardest thing with these projects, just figuring out how and where to start. After I get some of the files created and get rolling it gets simpler. 

The best part of working on my project was getting to the css part of it, I used bootstrap to do the styling of it, which is still pretty plain. I could spend hours working on the styling alone.

The general structure of the project is that I've got 4 models:

1. user - users can create a username with password to login and logout of the application
2. event - after creating a username, users can create events
3. expense - expenses belong to events, so users can create expenses with a cost and a quantity
4. guest - guests belong to events, so users can add guests to the guest list for the events

I enjoyed working on this project and really learning the different things you can accomplish through the rails framework.
