For as long as I can remember I have loved playing board games, beginning with all the childhood favorites that everyone has played, Don't wake daddy, Monopoly, Sorry, Clue, etc. Many would be surprised to know that there is so much more to board gaming then that. There are thousands and thousands of new board games out there. Even for people that have never been a fan of playing those classic board games, there is a game out there for everyone.

From games such as Viticulture, where each player runs their own vineyard harvesting grapes to create wine, to cooperative games such as pandemic, where everyone is working as a type of scientist to cure diseases from the earth before outbreaks occur spreading the diseases and wiping out everyone. I just recently started to learn of these "modern" board games and have fallen back in love with the hobby.

Because of my love for the hobby, I thought this would be the perfect project idea for my Sinatra/ActiveRecord portfolio project.

I created a board game app, where users can sign up with a unique user ID with a password, login, and track board games that they've added to their collection. Each game added has 4 attributes: 

* Name
* Type of game
* Number of Players
* Typical Play Time

After adding a game it will take the user to a show page, showing the attributes for the individual game, and add it to their collection. They can then edit or delete any game in their collection.

I had a lot of fun creating this project and hope to continue to add to it as I learn more and more about coding. This is definitely an app that I can see myself using to keep up with all of the games in my collection.
